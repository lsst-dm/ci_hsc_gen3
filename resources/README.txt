The "external.yaml" file here is produced by running:

    bin/exportExternalData.py $CI_HSC_GEN2_DIR/DATAgen3 resources/external.yaml

with a built copy of ci_hsc_gen2 set up.

This exports information about bright object masks, reference catalogs, and
master calibrations from ci_hsc_gen2's Gen3 data repository, with filenames
relative to the testdata_ci_hsc directory.  That YAML file is committed to
git rather than regenerated by SCons in order to avoid having ci_hsc_gen3
depend on ci_hsc_gen2, and to allow other processes that are not dependent
on Gen2 to produce this file in the future.
